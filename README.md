Meat tax research by Animal Ask

This code was written by Animal Ask as part of our research into a meat tax campaign for the UK. The purpose of this code is to reproduce our detailed analysis, mostly to check for errors.

This code runs in the open-source statistical programming software R, which can be downloaded for free at https://cran.r-project.org/

We have provided the following files. The first is the R file that contains the code. There are also two CSV files that contain the data we used in our analysis.
animal_ask_meat_tax_2022.R
animal_ask_meat_tax_2022_data_scenarios.CSV
animal_ask_meat_tax_2022_data_variables.CSV

You can find the main version of our detailed analysis in the Google spreadsheet here:

Animal Ask has been founded with the express aim to optimise and prioritise farmed animal welfare asks. We conduct in-depth research, narrowly targeted at key decisions between different animal asks, supporting animal charities, donors, policymakers, and governments so that they may do more good in the long term.
